This a c sharp console application that works like a calculator. 
It could do basic arithmethic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and modulous.
It can store previous results using lists.
Switch statement, arrays, lists, data type, operators, lambda operator etc., are covered in this project.
I have intentionally not considered the case: divide by zero.
